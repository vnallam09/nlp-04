stage01_extract.py - Stage 01: Extract
(NO EDITS REQUIRED IN THIS FILE)

Source: API
Sink: raw JSON object + raw JSON file

The Extract stage is responsible for retrieving data
from the source (in this case, an API)
and saving it to a file.
It also returns the extracted data as a Python object
for use in subsequent stages.
