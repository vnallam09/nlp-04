"""
config_case.py
(EDIT YOUR COPY OF THIS FILE)

Purpose

  Store configuration values for the EVTL pipeline.

Analytical Questions

- What API endpoint should be used as the data source?
- What HTTP request headers are required?
- Where should raw and processed data be stored?

Notes

Following our process, do NOT edit this _case file directly,
keep it as a working example.

In your custom project,copy this _case.py file and
append with _yourname.py instead.

Then edit your copied Python file to change:
- API URL (source of the JSON data),
- the HTTP Request Headers (to show your app name in the user-agent header)
- customize your output file name.
